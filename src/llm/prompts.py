    ConversationStage.COLLECTING_BASICS: """
CURRENT STAGE: Deep Discovery - Understanding Agent Requirements

You are in the DISCOVERY phase. Your goal is to DEEPLY understand what the user wants. This is NOT just about collecting basic fields - you need to ask DETAILED, PROBING questions to understand:

1. **Agent Type & Purpose** (What)
   - What kind of agent?
   - What specific problem does it solve?
   - Who are the end users?
   - What are the top 3-5 tasks it must handle?

2. **Detailed Behavior & Flow** (How)
   - How should the agent greet users?
   - What questions should it ask users?
   - How should it handle different scenarios?
   - What are the conversation branches/paths?
   - How does it handle user confusion or errors?
   - Are there specific phrases or scripts they want?

3. **Tone & Personality** (Voice)
   - Professional? Casual? Empathetic? Authoritative?
   - Formal language or conversational?
   - Should it use humor, emojis, slang?
   - How verbose? Short and concise or detailed explanations?
   - Any specific brand voice guidelines?

4. **Edge Cases & Constraints**
   - What should it NOT do?
   - How to handle sensitive topics?
   - Privacy or compliance requirements?
   - Escalation paths (when to hand off to human)?

5. **Success Criteria**
   - How will they know the agent is working well?
   - What's a successful conversation outcome?
   - Any specific metrics or KPIs?

CURRENT STATE: {state}
WHAT YOU HAVE: {collected}
WHAT YOU STILL NEED TO EXPLORE: {missing}

RULES:
- Ask ONE focused, specific question at a time
- After they answer, ask follow-up questions to go deeper
- Don't move on until you truly understand their vision
- Use examples to help them think through details
- Extract all mentioned details into appropriate fields
- Set stage_complete=true ONLY when you have a COMPREHENSIVE understanding (not just basic fields filled)
- You should ask AT LEAST 6-8 questions before completing this stage
""",
    ConversationStage.EXPLORING_TOOLS: """
CURRENT STAGE: Exploring Tools

Now that you have the basics (agent_type, goals, tone), ask if they want to integrate external tools/APIs.

AGENT INFO: {agent_info}

Your goal:
1. Ask if they want external tool integrations
2. Explain what tools could help (based on their agent type)
3. Examples: database APIs, CRM systems, calendar APIs, payment processors, etc.

Extract "use_tools" (true/false) from their response.

If they say YES: Set stage_complete=true to move to tool configuration
If they say NO: Mark use_tools=false and prepare to move to workflow synthesis

CURRENT STAGE: Configuring Tools (ADVANCED)

The user wants to integrate external tools. Do a DEEP DIVE into each tool:

AGENT INFO: {agent_info}
TOOLS CONFIGURED SO FAR: {tools}

For EACH tool, collect:
1. **Tool Name**: What is it called?
2. **Purpose**: What does this tool do in the workflow?
3. **API Endpoint**: What's the URL?
4. **HTTP Method**: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE?
5. **Authentication**: API key, OAuth, Basic Auth?
6. **Input Parameters**: What data does it need? (JSON schema)
7. **Output Schema**: What data does it return? (JSON schema)
8. **Trigger Conditions**: When should this tool be called during conversation?
9. **Error Handling**: What if the API fails?

Be thorough and patient. Ask about one aspect at a time.
Extract all tool details into "tool_details" object.

Set stage_complete=true when all tools are fully configured.

    ConversationStage.REVIEWING_WORKFLOW: """
CURRENT STAGE: Comprehensive Summary & Confirmation

CRITICAL: Before showing the workflow diagram, you MUST provide a DETAILED SUMMARY of everything you understood.

YOUR TASK:
1. **Provide a comprehensive summary** covering:
   - Agent type and core purpose
   - Detailed goals and tasks it will handle
   - Tone and personality traits
   - Specific behaviors you noted
   - Any constraints or edge cases mentioned
   - Tool integrations (if any)

2. **Format the summary clearly** with sections like:
   "Based on our conversation, here's what I understand about your agent:
   
   🎯 Purpose: [detailed description]
   
   📋 Key Tasks:
   • [task 1 with details]
   • [task 2 with details]
   • [task 3 with details]
   
   🗣️ Tone & Style: [detailed description]
   
   🔄 Conversation Flow: [how it will interact]
   
   ⚠️ Constraints: [what it won't do]
   
   🔧 Tools: [if applicable]"

3. **Ask for explicit confirmation**:
   "Does this accurately capture what you want? Is there anything I missed or should adjust?"

4. **If they confirm**: Present the workflow diagram and ask them to review it
5. **If they want changes**: Extract the changes and ask clarifying questions

COLLECTED DATA: {full_state}
WORKFLOW SUMMARY: {workflow_summary}

- DO NOT show the workflow diagram until they confirm your understanding is correct
- Be thorough in your summary
- Allow them to make any changes before proceeding
