# 📊 Development Progress

## ✅ Phase 1: Session Management & Storage (COMPLETED)

### What We Built

#### 1. **Session Management System**
- ✅ Unique session ID generation (UUID)
- ✅ Session state stored in Redis (active conversations)
- ✅ Session metadata stored in SQLite (permanent records)
- ✅ Session expiry handling (configurable TTL)
- ✅ Session resumption capability

#### 2. **Database Setup**
- ✅ SQLAlchemy models for `Session` table
- ✅ Alembic migrations configured
- ✅ Initial migration created and applied
- ✅ Support for both SQLite and PostgreSQL

#### 3. **Redis Integration**
- ✅ Redis client with connection handling
- ✅ Session state serialization/deserialization
- ✅ TTL-based session expiry
- ✅ Username/password authentication support

#### 4. **API Endpoints**
All endpoints tested and working:
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/sessions/create` - Create new session
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/message` - Send message
- ✅ `GET /api/v1/sessions/{id}/status` - Get session status
- ✅ `POST /api/v1/sessions/{id}/resume` - Resume session
- ✅ `DELETE /api/v1/sessions/{id}` - Delete session

#### 5. **Data Models**
- ✅ `SessionStatus` enum (active, completed, abandoned)
- ✅ `ConversationStage` enum (7 stages defined)
- ✅ `SessionState` schema (full conversation context)
- ✅ `ToolConfigSchema` (for tool configurations)
- ✅ Request/Response schemas for all endpoints

#### 6. **Infrastructure**
- ✅ FastAPI application with CORS
- ✅ Environment configuration with Pydantic
- ✅ Database connection pooling
- ✅ Error handling middleware
- ✅ Request timing middleware
- ✅ Health check endpoint
- ✅ API documentation (Swagger + ReDoc)

#### 7. **Project Structure**
- ✅ Modular feature-based architecture
- ✅ Each feature has own models, schemas, router
- ✅ Central imports for convenience
- ✅ Proper Python package structure

#### 8. **Development Tools**
- ✅ Requirements.txt with all dependencies
- ✅ .env configuration
- ✅ .gitignore configured
- ✅ README with setup instructions
- ✅ Test script (test_api.py)

### Testing Results

**All systems operational! ✅**

```bash
# Server started successfully
✅ Health check: http://localhost:8000/health

# Session creation working
✅ Created session: c2c512ae-6ba0-47e6-8132-8146dd0456b5

# Message sending working
✅ Messages stored in conversation history

# Status tracking working
✅ Progress tracking: 0% (awaiting user info)
```

## 🔨 Phase 2: Conversation Orchestrator (NEXT)

### Goal
Build the AI-powered conversation engine that intelligently asks questions and guides users through the agent creation process.

### Components to Build

#### 1. **LLM Integration Layer** (`src/llm/`)
- [ ] OpenAI client wrapper
- [ ] Anthropic client wrapper
- [ ] LiteLLM for multi-provider support
- [ ] Rate limiting and error handling
- [ ] Token usage tracking
- [ ] Response caching (optional)

#### 2. **Conversation Orchestrator** (`src/orchestrator/`)
- [ ] Dynamic question generation based on context
- [ ] Conversation flow management
- [ ] Stage progression logic
- [ ] Context window management
- [ ] Response formatting

**Key Functions:**
```python
# Generate next question based on session state
async def generate_next_question(session_state: SessionState) -> str

# Determine conversation stage from context
async def determine_stage(conversation_history: List) -> ConversationStage

# Check if enough information collected
def is_stage_complete(session_state: SessionState) -> bool
```

#### 3. **Integration Points**
- [ ] Update `src/session/router.py` to call orchestrator
- [ ] Replace placeholder response in `/message` endpoint
- [ ] Add orchestrator to app initialization

### Expected Behavior After Phase 2

```
User: "I want to build a customer support agent"
AI: "Great! What specific goals should this customer support agent achieve?"

User: "Help customers with order tracking and returns"
AI: "Perfect! What tone should your agent have? Should it be formal, friendly, professional, or something else?"

User: "Friendly and empathetic"
AI: "Excellent! Would you like this agent to integrate with any external tools or APIs, such as order management systems or databases?"
```

## 📋 Phase 3: Intent Extractor (AFTER PHASE 2)

Extract structured information from natural conversations.

### Components
- [ ] NLP-based entity extraction
- [ ] Validation logic
- [ ] Session state updater
- [ ] Confidence scoring

---

## 📋 Phase 4: Tool Selector (AFTER PHASE 3)

Help users configure external tool integrations.

### Components
- [ ] Tool detection from conversation
- [ ] Common tools library (calendar, CRM, etc.)
- [ ] API endpoint configuration
- [ ] Input/output schema builder

---

## 📋 Phase 5: Workflow Synthesizer (AFTER PHASE 4)

Compile all collected data into a structured workflow.

### Components
- [ ] Flow representation (state machine)
- [ ] Visual flow generator (Mermaid.js)
- [ ] Review and edit interface
- [ ] Workflow validation

---

## 📋 Phase 6: Prompt Generator (AFTER PHASE 5)

Generate the final system prompt and configurations.

### Components
- [ ] Prompt template system
- [ ] Dynamic prompt generation
- [ ] Tool configuration export
- [ ] Platform-specific formatting (ElevenLabs, OpenAI, etc.)

## 🚀 How to Continue Development

### To Start Phase 2:

1. **Add LLM API keys to `.env`**
   ```env
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
   ```

2. **Create LLM integration module**
   ```bash
   mkdir src/llm
   touch src/llm/__init__.py
   touch src/llm/client.py
   touch src/llm/prompts.py
   ```

3. **Create orchestrator module**
   ```bash
   mkdir src/orchestrator
   touch src/orchestrator/__init__.py
   touch src/orchestrator/conversation.py
   touch src/orchestrator/stages.py
   ```

4. **Integrate with session router**
   - Import orchestrator in `src/session/router.py`
   - Replace placeholder response with actual LLM calls
   - Add stage progression logic

---

## 📝 Notes

- All database tables created via migrations (version controlled)
- Redis connection tested and working
- API fully documented at `/docs`
- Modular structure allows easy feature additions
- Environment variables configured for different LLM providers

**Ready to build Phase 2! 🚀**
