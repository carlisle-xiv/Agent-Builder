I have this idea to build to build a sort of a flow to better assist users in the creation of system prompts for a voice agent
so just like how elevenlabs works, you have a system prompt and then you have tools, user can decide to use the tools or not, the tools work by extracting certain data from the conversation and then submitting it to an endpoint and then receiving a response
now the problem, most users have a flow in mind which they want to create a voice agent for but do not know how to articulate the words to create the workflow which in turn is used to create the system prompt for the agent and then if the user wants to make user of tools, the user wouldn't know how to

so what I want to do is to leverage on ai for that flow so user comes in, the ai asks the user what kind of agent would you like to create and then the ai keeps asking the user intelligent questions and also ask  the user if he or she would like to use any external tools if yes, then ask the user questions on how the user intends to use the tool(s) and how it will be used in the flow then at the end of the user giving the ai all the information, if no the ai continues to build the workflow for the user to review and then after the user confirms or makes any changes then the ai gives the user the system prompt and tools required(if possible) to be used for the agent

I want to use LLM's like gpt 5, claude and other ones, the programming language I want to use is python

and after that will ask the user if the user would like to use any external

let's talk about how to achieve this

Perfect ‚Äî this is an excellent idea, Edmond. You‚Äôre essentially describing an AI-powered ‚Äúagent builder assistant‚Äù ‚Äî a meta-agent that helps users design their own conversational agents by guiding them through a structured, natural dialogue. Let‚Äôs break down how you can bring this to life, step by step.

üß© 1. The Core Concept

The product idea can be summarized as:

‚ÄúAn AI flow that helps users design voice agents (with optional tool integrations) by conversing with them naturally, clarifying intent, and generating system prompts + tool configurations automatically.‚Äù

You‚Äôre essentially abstracting away prompt engineering and flow design ‚Äî which is a huge barrier for non-technical users.

üß† 2. Architectural Overview

Here‚Äôs a high-level view of how you might structure it:

User
  ‚Üì
Interactive AI Flow (LLM-powered)
  ‚Üì
User Intent + Context Elicitation
  ‚Üì
Workflow Builder (structured representation of conversation logic)
  ‚Üì
Prompt & Tool Generator
  ‚Üì
Final System Prompt + Config (JSON or YAML)

Key Components

Conversation Orchestrator (AI flow engine)

Drives the back-and-forth with the user.

Uses an LLM (GPT-5, Claude 3.5, etc.) to dynamically generate next questions.

Stores answers in a structured memory (e.g., JSON schema or knowledge graph).

Intent Extractor

Analyzes the conversation to identify:

Agent type (e.g., customer support, booking, educational, etc.)

Goals

Tone and persona

Required tools / APIs

Tool Selector

If the user opts to use external tools, the system proposes integrations (e.g., calendar API, CRM API, weather API).

Collects details like:

Input/output parameters

Trigger conditions

Example use cases

Workflow Synthesizer

Compiles all collected data into a structured flow (e.g., using a state machine representation, or LangGraph-style node graph).

Can visualize or export this flow.

Prompt Generator

Converts the structured flow into a system prompt that defines the agent‚Äôs role, behavior, and constraints.

Optionally outputs in formats compatible with ElevenLabs, OpenAI assistants, or custom agent frameworks.

Implementation Flow (Step-by-Step)

Here‚Äôs how I‚Äôd suggest approaching it incrementally:

Step 1: Define the Interaction Loop

Build the conversational scaffolding:

def ask_user(question):
    return input(question + "\n> ")

def collect_info():
    context = {}
    context['agent_type'] = ask_user("What kind of voice agent would you like to create?")
    context['goals'] = ask_user("What should this agent help users achieve?")
    context['tone'] = ask_user("How should your agent sound (friendly, professional, humorous, etc.)?")
    return context


Later, replace input() with an LLM-driven question generator (see Step 3).

Step 2: Define Your Schema

Use Pydantic to formalize what ‚Äúagent data‚Äù looks like:

from pydantic import BaseModel
from typing import List, Optional

class ToolConfig(BaseModel):
    name: str
    endpoint: str
    input_schema: dict
    output_schema: dict
    usage_context: str

class AgentFlow(BaseModel):
    agent_type: str
    goals: str
    tone: str
    tools: Optional[List[ToolConfig]]
    prompt: Optional[str]

Step 3: Add LLM-Driven Elicitation

Instead of manually coding every question, use an LLM to decide what to ask next based on what‚Äôs missing:

from openai import OpenAI

client = OpenAI()

def next_question(conversation_state):
    prompt = f"""
    The user is building a voice agent. Here is what they‚Äôve said so far:
    {conversation_state}

    Ask the next most relevant question to help you design their agent workflow.
    Be concise and natural.
    """
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content

Step 4: Add Tool Exploration Flow

When user says yes to tools:

if use_tools:
    tool_name = ask_user("What‚Äôs the name or type of tool you want to integrate?")
    tool_endpoint = ask_user("What API or endpoint will it use?")
    tool_usecase = ask_user("When should this tool be called during the conversation?")


Then convert these answers into ToolConfig objects.

Step 5: Generate the Final Prompt

Finally, use the LLM again to create the system prompt:

def generate_system_prompt(agent_flow: AgentFlow):
    prompt = f"""
    Create a system prompt for a voice agent with the following details:
    - Type: {agent_flow.agent_type}
    - Goals: {agent_flow.goals}
    - Tone: {agent_flow.tone}
    - Tools: {agent_flow.tools}

    The prompt should be clear, structured, and production-ready.
    """
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-5",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": prompt}]
    )
    agent_flow.prompt = response.choices[0].message.content
    return agent_flow

üåê 6. (Optional) Multi-LLM Routing

Since you mentioned using GPT-5 and Claude:

You can route queries based on capability:

GPT for creative prompt generation and flow logic.

Claude for conversational elicitation (it‚Äôs great at empathetic questioning).

Libraries like LiteLLM or LangChain‚Äôs RouterChain make this easy.

üîÑ 7. Future Additions

Auto-generate visual flows (using Mermaid.js or a React flow editor).
